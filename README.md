*🎗️🧠 ThriveWell – Your Personalized Mental Health & Well-Being Companion*


**🌟 Core Idea:**
A mental health support app that offers personalized insights, coping strategies, and daily motivation for people navigating life challenges—whether that’s recovery from illness, managing stress, or simply enhancing emotional well-being.


**🔍 Key Features**

***📓 Daily Emotional Journal (RAG-Powered)***
   - Users log their thoughts/moods.
   - AI Analysis: Detects emotional patterns using sentiment analysis.
   - RAG System: Retrieves relevant coping strategies, mindfulness exercises, and inspirational content tailored to current emotional states.

***🌈 Mood Tracker with AI Insights***
- Visualizes emotional trends over time (e.g., mood graphs).
- Identifies potential triggers based on journal entries.
- Proactive Recommendations: Suggests activities like breathing exercises, gratitude prompts, or gentle movement routines.

***🎯 Personalized Wellness Plans***
- Based on user goals: stress reduction, recovery support, anxiety management, etc.
- Dynamic plans that adapt as the user’s needs change.

***💬 Support Companion (Chatbot Feature)***
- A friendly, AI-powered chatbot for quick emotional check -ins.
- Offers motivational messages, grounding techniques, or even light conversation to ease loneliness.

***🤝 Community & Peer Support (Optional)***
- Anonymous forums or groups for users to connect with others facing similar challenges.

***⚠️ Crisis Detection & Resources***
- Recognizes signs of emotional distress and gently suggests seeking professional help.
- Quick-access emergency resources if needed.


**⚙️ Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Flask (API & user management)
- OAuth, 2FA (tbd)
- Database: PostgreSQL (store user data securely)
- RAG System:
- Vector Database (e.g., FAISS or Elasticsearch) for storing coping strategies, motivational content, and articles.
- OpenAI for generating personalized responses.
- Frontend: Could start simple with a Flask-based UI, then expand to mobile if desired.


**❤️ Why This Project Stands Out:**
- AI Complexity: Combines sentiment analysis, RAG techniques, and even a chatbot feature.
- Social Good: A project with real emotional value that can make a difference.
