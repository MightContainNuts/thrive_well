## Feature: Code Refactoring
As a developer, I want to refactor [specific code/module] so that it improves maintainability, readability, and efficiency without changing functionality.

## Scenario: Refactoring the Code
Given the current implementation,  
When I refactor the code following best practices,  
Then it should maintain the same functionality while being cleaner and more efficient.

## Refactoring Details

- **Type of Refactoring:** [Optimization / Readability / Structure / Performance]  
- **Priority:** [Low / Medium / High]  
- **Complexity:** [Small / Medium / Large]  

## Steps to Complete
1. [Step 1: Identify areas for refactoring]  
2. [Step 2: Implement changes]  
3. [Step 3: Validate correctness with tests]  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The refactored code maintains existing functionality  
- [ ] Readability and maintainability are improved  
- [ ] Performance is optimized (if applicable)  
- [ ] Tests pass successfully  
- [ ] Documentation is updated if necessary  

## Additional Context
